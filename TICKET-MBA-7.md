# Ticket MBA-7: Backend User Management API

## Title
Implement a RESTful User Management API with Authentication

## Description
Create a lightweight backend API service for user management functionality. This service should provide basic CRUD operations for user accounts with proper authentication and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Registration Endpoint
- **GIVEN** a new user wants to register
- **WHEN** they send a POST request to `/api/users/register` with valid user data
- **THEN** the system should create a new user account and return a 201 status with user details (excluding password)
- **AND** the password should be securely hashed before storage

### AC2: User Authentication Endpoint  
- **GIVEN** a registered user wants to authenticate
- **WHEN** they send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with valid credentials
- **THEN** the system should return a JWT token with 200 status
- **AND** invalid credentials should return 401 status with error message

### AC3: Get User Profile Endpoint
- **GIVEN** an authenticated user wants to view their profile
- **WHEN** they send a GET request to `/api/users/profile` with valid JWT token
- **THEN** the system should return user profile data with 200 status
- **AND** requests without valid token should return 401 status

### AC4: Update User Profile Endpoint
- **GIVEN** an authenticated user wants to update their profile
- **WHEN** they send a PUT request to `/api/users/profile` with valid data and JWT token
- **THEN** the system should update the user profile and return updated data with 200 status
- **AND** only allow updates to email and name fields

### AC5: Data Validation
- **GIVEN** any user data input
- **WHEN** the data is processed by any endpoint
- **THEN** the system should validate email format, password strength (min 8 chars), and required fields
- **AND** return 400 status with validation errors for invalid data

### AC6: Error Handling
- **GIVEN** any API request
- **WHEN** an error occurs during processing
- **THEN** the system should return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
- **AND** log errors for debugging purposes

## Technical Requirements
- Use FastAPI framework
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Use SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Include proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Include basic error handling and logging
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are implemented and tested
- [ ] API endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Authentication flow works correctly
- [ ] Data validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] API documentation is accessible via Swagger UI
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 standards
- [ ] Basic tests are written and passing

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Ensure security best practices for password handling
- Make sure all endpoints are properly documented
